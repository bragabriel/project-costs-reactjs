# Project Manager - React.js

A simple project management app built with **React.js**.  
Created as a practice project to learn React fundamentals and how to work with a mocked backend API. 🚀

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```
Installs all project dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### 2. Start the mocked backend
In one terminal window, run:

```
npm run backend
```
This will serve your backend API at http://localhost:5000.

Starts the mocked backend server using json-server on port 5000. Serves data from the `db.json` file.

### 3. Start the React frontend
In another terminal window, run:

```
npm start
```
The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000, making API requests to the mocked backend.

## 📋 Notes
The backend is mocked using json-server with data from the db.json file.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Make sure you have json-server installed globally or as a project dependency to run npm run backend.
